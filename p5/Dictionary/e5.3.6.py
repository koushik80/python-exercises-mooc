# E-5.3.6: Invert a dictionary

# Problem: Please write a function named invert(dictionary: dict),
# which takes a dictionary as its argument.
# The dictionary should be inverted in place so that values become keys and keys become values.

# An example of its use:

#s = {1: "first", 2: "second", 3: "third", 4: "fourth"}
# invert(s)
# print(s)


# Sample output:

#{"first": 1, "second": 2, "third": 3, "fourth": 4}

# NB: the principles regarding lists covered here also hold for dictionaries passed as arguments.
