# E-5.1.1: The longest string

# Problem:Please write a function named longest(strings: list),
# which takes a list of strings as its argument.
# The function finds and returns the longest string in the list.
# You may assume there is always a single longest string in the list.

# An example of expected behaviour:


# if __name__ == "__main__":
#strings = ["hi", "hiya", "hello", "howdydoody", "hi there"]
# print(longest(strings))


# Sample output:

# howdydoody

# Solution:
