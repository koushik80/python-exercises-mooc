# E-5.4.5: A square of letters

# Problem:This final exercise in this part is a relatively demanding problem solving task.
# It can be solved in many different ways.
# Even though this current section in the material covers tuples,
# tuples are not necessarily the best way to go about solving this.

# Please write a program which prints out a square of letters as specified in the examples below.
# You may assume there will be at most 26 layers.


# Sample output:

#Layers: 3
# CCCCC
# CBBBC
# CBABC
# CBBBC
# CCCCC

# Sample output:

#Layers: 4
# DDDDDDD
# DCCCCCD
# DCBBBCD
# DCBABCD
# DCBBBCD
# DCCCCCD
# DDDDDDD

# NB: this exercise doesn't ask you to write any functions,
# so you should not place any code within an if __name__ == "__main__" block.

# Solution:
