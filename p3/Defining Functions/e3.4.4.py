#E-3.4.4:Print many times

#Problem: Please write a function named print_many_times(text, times),
#which takes a string and an integer as arguments.
#The integer argument specifies how many times the string argument should be printed out:

        #print_many_times("hi", 5)

        #print()

        #text = "All Pythons, except one, grow up"
        #times = 3
        #print_many_times(text, times)

#Sample output:

        #hi
        #hi
        #hi
        #hi
        #hi

        #All Pythons, except one, grow up.
        #All Pythons, except one, grow up.
        #All Pythons, except one, grow up.

#Solution:
