#E-1.5: Print some code

#Problem: Thus far, you have probably used double quotation marks " to print out strings.
#In addition to the double quotation marks,
#Python also accepts single quotation marks '.

#This comes in handy if you ever want to print out the actual quotation marks themselves:

#Please write a program which prints out the following:

              #print("Hello there!")

#Solution:

print('print("Hello there!")')
