#E-2.5: Story

#Problem: Please write a program which prints out the following story.
#The user gives a name and a year, which should be inserted into the printout.

                #Please type in a name: Mary
                #Please type in a year: 1572

#Mary is valiant knight, born in the year 1572.
#One morning Mary woke up to an awful racket:
#a dragon was approaching the village.
#Only Mary could save the village's residents.

#The story should change according to the input given by the user.


#Solution:

name = input("Please type in a name: ")
year = input("Please type in a year: ")


print(name,"is valiant knight,", "born in the year",year+".","One morning",
      name,"woke up to an awful racket:"," a dragon was approaching the village.","Only",name,"could save the village's residents.")
