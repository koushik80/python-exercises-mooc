#E4.3.5: List twice

#Problem:Please write a program which asks the user to type in values and adds them to a list.
#After each addition, the list is printed out in two different ways:

    #§in the order the items were added
    #§ordered from smallest to greatest

#The program exits when the user types in 0.

#An example of expected behaviour:


#Sample output:

        #New item: 3
        #The list now: [3]
        #The list in order: [3]
        #New item: 1
        #The list now: [3, 1]
        #The list in order: [1, 3]
        #New item: 9
        #The list now: [3, 1, 9]
        #The list in order: [1, 3, 9]
        #New item: 5
        #The list now: [3, 1, 9, 5]
        #The list in order: [1, 3, 5, 9]
        #New item: 0
        #Bye!

#NB: this exercise doesn't ask you to write any functions,
#so you should not place any code within an if __name__ == "__main__" block.
