# E-4.6.6:Grade statistics

# Problem:In this exercise you will write a program for printing out grade statistics for a university course.

# The program asks the user for results from different students on the course. These include exam points and numbers of exercises completed. The program then prints out statistics based on the results.

# Exam points are integers between 0 and 20. The number of exercises completed is an integer between 0 and 100.

# Exam points and exercises completed: 15 87
# Exam points and exercises completed: 10 55
# Exam points and exercises completed: 11 40
# Exam points and exercises completed: 4 17
# Exam points and exercises completed:
